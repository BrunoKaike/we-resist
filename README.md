We resist is an artistic (non-profit) 2D platformer prototype that explores the life of a wet nurse in the colonial period. The game tells the story of Yalie, a wet nurse, who is on the run after murdering her mistress(slaveholders' wife).

## Objective
We Resist was conceived with the purpose of presenting how the pain and marks of slavery followed black people, especially wet nurses, throughout what could no longer be called life, but a nightmare.
Project developed and presented to the IT course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, as a partial requirement for approval in the Fundamentals of Digital Games discipline, taught by Professor Luisa Rocha de Azevedo Santos(*<luisa.ras97@gmail.com >*).
## About the project
The We Resist project was developed using the Unity 3D engine and programmed in C#.
All the artistic part was developed by the team using tools such as Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Rebelle 3.
